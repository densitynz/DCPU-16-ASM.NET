DCPU-16 ASM.NET
 is a simple open source DCPU-16 Assembler and Emulator, developed in C#. 

This project's core objectives are:

* Full DCPU-16 emulation, as per Notch's specs.
* A hopefully reasonable back-end Assembler for others to use in their tools 
  (Providing a full IDE+Toolchain is not my intent with this project at this stage). 
* Giving me something stress-free to do. 


All sub v1.0 commits here will be in-development commits. Parts may/may not work. 

Current TODOs:
* Finish basic emulation (basically Keyboard & Screen working). 
* compile time mathmatical expressions in literal fields. 
* HUGE clean up of the code, its a mess!
