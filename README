Ok, I highly recommend you modify program.cs, I've messed with it to test out my Emulator in progress!


This will Assemble most dcpu16 code out there.. The only thing I don't handle is the RESERVE keyword. 

This can handle some extra features, for example

character as operators! 
SET X, 'a' 

SET I, ['A'+B] 

etc. 

There are still some limitations.. But based on suggestions I'll work around them. 


My core goal right now is to get the emulator up to a reasonable standard, including WinForm interface, and
when it is available. Fully support the offical Memory Address space.
